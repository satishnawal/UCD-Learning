Kindly ponder if distance sensor or proximity sensor could be used in determining a car dent or damage on the car. ,{'neu': 0.738, 'compound': 0.0, 'pos': 0.131, 'neg': 0.131}
A distance sensor fixed in four directions of the car with a fixed detection of the range of motion to the peripheral or outer body of the car would determine any change or damage in the outer body upon an accident. ,{'neu': 0.855, 'compound': -0.743, 'pos': 0.0, 'neg': 0.145}
Such sensors would give peace of mind to a driver when a car is parked and unsupervised.,{'neu': 0.8, 'compound': 0.5423, 'pos': 0.2, 'neg': 0.0}

Just because of the money. One thing is diversity,  which includes  tolerance with who thinks differently, and another is permisivity. ,{'neu': 0.896, 'compound': 0.296, 'pos': 0.104, 'neg': 0.0}
One thing is not to discriminate homosexuals  and another thing is to promote them. Then, to be consistent, they should do it for each minority, but I don't see it. See  what I mean? Just because of the money.,{'neu': 0.952, 'compound': 0.2023, 'pos': 0.048, 'neg': 0.0}
Kindly ponder if the left and right indicator lever in the car should be moved to the steering wheel for the following reasons: 1. ,{'neu': 0.878, 'compound': 0.4939, 'pos': 0.122, 'neg': 0.0}
The most common object we touch after steering wheel is indicator lever and it is placed behind the steering wheel. 2. The use of indicator lever requires upward and downward movement of index finger which is against the natural movement of the finger. 3. A touch button indicator on the steering wheel will ensure soft and gentle application of indicator and will ensure both hands on the wheel of the driver. 4. The indicator could be turned off with the turning of the steering wheel or a touch of opposite side of indicator button. ,{'neu': 0.892, 'compound': 0.8625, 'pos': 0.108, 'neg': 0.0}

You guys need to give Acura some love. Seems like Honda is mor focused on and gets the most modern features, engines, and designs. Growing up it was the opposite. ,{'neu': 0.703, 'compound': 0.875, 'pos': 0.297, 'neg': 0.0}
